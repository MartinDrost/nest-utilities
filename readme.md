## Introduction

The nest-utilities package is meant as a helper layer for your Nest application. The package offers classes to create consistency in your code and to prevent repeating menial tasks and repetetive coding like writing CRUD functionalities.

### Version 7.x docs will be made available later this week.

Because of a major overhaul of the nest-utilities' core it's recommended to wait for the new docs before updating.

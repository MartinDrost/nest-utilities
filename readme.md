## Description
In order to keep consistency in CRUD applications you often find yourself writing the same functionality for each new module. Nest-utilities offers a set of basic endpoints and query parameters out of the box while keeping module specific authentication and data manipulation in mind.

Nest-utilities aims for performance and developer experience to keep you focused on building features instead of implementing menial tasks.

Consult the [wiki](https://github.com/MartinDrost/nest-utilities/wiki) for more detailed documentation.
